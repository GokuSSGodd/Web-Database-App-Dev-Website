                Hi, my name is Murtaza Amjad and I’m currently a Computer Science student at the University of New Haven. I have a strong interest in secure software engineering and artificial intelligence, with hands-on experience in building applications, working with databases, and exploring secure software development practices. I serve as the President of the Computer Programming Club, where I lead workshops, projects, and collaborations that help students sharpen their technical skills. Outside of academics, I enjoy developing startup-style projects like SendIt, a secure file-transfer system, and contributing to hackathons and research. My goal is to combine technical innovation with problem-solving to create impactful solutions that bridge software development and security
